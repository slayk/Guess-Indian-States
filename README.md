# Guess-Indian-States

An educational game made using pandas and turtle.

- A game which shows you the political map of India and leaves it upto you to guess the states.
- A pop up appears which allows you to enter the name of the State you have guessed.
- If the guess made by you is correct, the score will be increased on the pop up else it won't.
- The game keeps going till you have reached the total number of states.
- If you want to exit the game or can't guess no more, type "exit" in the pop up.
- Once the game ends, it generates a CSV files consisting of all the State names you couldn't guess.
- This gives you a chance to learn and play the game and test your knowledge once again.

Hope you enjoy playing the game as much as I enjoyed making it.
